            <p class="paragraph1">Over the course of 6 weeks we provided a students from all over the San Diego School District with free breakfast and lunch, fun commmunity service work, and an amiable classroom environment with there peers. The students ranges from 6-14 years of age and collarborating with all age groups was charming.</p>
            <h3 class="header">Challenges</h3>
            <p class="paragraph1"> It wasn't always easy keeping the kids under control and very often you had to earn their respects for them to listen to your instructions. Six weeks, two week per different age group, was not enough to build a strong connections with the kids. I tried to learn at least one fact about the kids so they'd see that I did truly care for them. I limited my authoritative tone so when I used it they knew I was serious but I didn't have to use it as they were under control most of the time. </p>

      <h3 class="header2">Overview</h3>
      <p class="paragraphCta">I took my first ever computing/programming course in college as a way to challenge myselg and learn skills that can be beneficial in a technological world. I learned, most notably: HTML, Bootstarp, and Excel over the course of 10 weeks.</p>
      <h3 class="header2">Challenges</h3>
      <p class="paragraphCta"> Previously, I only knew how to work my very basic computer. I wanted to challenge myself with skills I knew would be hard but would end up teaching me so much. Although I did have some late nights trying to firgure out programming langanage and styling frameworks I am very proud of my results. I would often have to go to lab and ask for help which taught me to advocate for myself and I have no problem doing it for others as well. </p>

      <h3 class="header">Overview</h3>
      <p class="paragraph1">Over the course of 2 months I had the opportunity to work in a local community's garden. I worked with crops and assisted people with their garden orders. I often had to check-in customers that would come in to our pop-out restuarant every weekend. In, addition I also worked on the company's newletter for customers by taking pictures around the garden and writing short stories to accompany them.
      <h3 class="header">Challenges</h3>
      <p class="paragraph1"> Adjusting to the fast pace in the customer service industry is difficult but I tried to develop a routine I could rely on most of the time. I arrived early on our busy days and I would organize orders in the most efficient way possible. I would try to time myself with each order becuase I did not want the customers waiting loger than 15 minutes maximum. As a customer myself I dislike when I have to wait long. Putting myself in their shoes also helped when particular customers weren't the nicest. </p>
